                    By feeding them using pancakes, giving them attention and cleaning them, your Nikogotchi will live for a very long time! Cleaning them and giving them attention is easy enough, but you'll need to buy pancakes from me!
                    
                    Just keep in mind that you can only have one Nikogotchi at a time. The only way to get another one is to  send away your current one or if it has passed away.
