# 💡 The World Machine 💡

### A quirky little bot based off the videogame Oneshot!
(https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/)

### We have various fun features such as:

🎶 A dynamic music module that supports Spotify and Soundcloud!

📺 Transmissions, based off userphone, which allows you to talk to other servers!

🪪 Show off your style with global profiles! Customize your background and description, and show off rare badges you earned or bought!

💬 Generate accurate Oneshot textboxes, anywhere, anytime. Now can you can make Niko say anything!

🤖 Talk to The World Machine! Using ChatGPT's API you can chat with the (sassy) entity, ask it questions and more!

💥 Also included is... destroying lightbulbs?*

###### * The creator of The World Machine does not condone destroying lightbulbs in real life, results could be catastrophic. Symptoms might include the sun being missing.

## Compiling The World Machine
#### ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS NOT MEANT TO BE EASY TO FORK OR CHANGE. THIS IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH ITS CODE.

### Step 1: Download Dependencies.
Download Python 3.11 and set it as your main interpreter in your code editor. To download dependencies, run this in your console:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should install all the libraries needed to run this bot.

### Step 2: config.json
To store API keys, passwords and more, there needs to be a 'config.json' file containing everything.
I won't disclose what those key pair values are, but with trial and error, I am sure you can eventually get everything.

### Step 3: Enjoy your World Machine clone.
Maybe it'll be better than this project!
